    "\n",
    "[Principal component analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) (PCA) performs a linear combination of our original features into new and linearly-uncorrelated features, called **principal components**. The principal components are constructed such that:\n",
    "- the first principal component is the direction of greatest variability in the data, i.e., it has the largest possible [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance);\n",

Well, consider the figure below, the direction of the first principal component (V1) has the largest spread (variance). It is also the direction that distorts the least our observations when performing a projection. In other words, the direction of the largest variance is also the direction that minimizes the distances between the original points and their projections. In this sense, it is the most informative direction.  \n",

    "#### Finding principal components\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we find the direction of largest variance? Let's formalize our problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a matrix of $p$ features $\\boldsymbol{X}=[\\boldsymbol{x_1}$, ... , $\\boldsymbol{x_p}]$, each feature having $n$ observations $\\boldsymbol{x_j}=(x_{1j}, x_{2j}, ..., x_{nj})$. We assume that the mean of each feature is zero; otherwise the first step is to center the data at zero by subtracting the mean of each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each principal component is a linear combination of our features, i.e., it can be represented by a vector of dimension $p$: $\\boldsymbol{\\phi_k} = (\\phi_{k,1}, \\phi_{k,2}, ..., \\phi_{k,p})$, where $\\phi_{k,j}$ are the weights associated with each feature. We impose that $\\boldsymbol{\\phi_k}$ is a unit vector, i.e., $|| \\boldsymbol{\\phi_k} ||=\\sum_j (\\phi_{k,j})^2=1$. Indeed, there exists an infinity of vectors that have the same direction, so we need to select one, and the unit vector leads to some interesting properties that we will discover below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each observation $i = 1,...,n$ and each principal component $k$, we define a principal component *score* $z_{k,i}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z_{k,i} = \\phi_{k,1} x_{i1} + \\phi_{k,2} x_{i2} + ... + \\phi_{k,p} x_{ip} = \\sum_{j=1}^p \\phi_{k,j} x_{ij} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $z_{k,i}$ is the scalar [projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_projection) of observation $i$ on the principal component $\\boldsymbol{\\phi_k}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first principal component is the direction of the largest variance. More explicitly, our problem consists in finding the weights $(\\phi_{1,1}, \\phi_{1,2}, ..., \\phi_{1,p})$ that maximizes the variance of the projections $\\boldsymbol{z_1}=(z_{1,1}, z_{1,2},..., z_{1,n})$, such that $\\boldsymbol{\\phi_1}$ is a unit vector. Note that since the mean of each feature is zero, the mean of $\\boldsymbol{z_1}$ is also zero. Hence, we need to solve the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{\\phi_1} = \\arg \\max_{|| \\boldsymbol{\\phi_1} || =1} \\left\\{  \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (z_{1,i})^2 \\right \\} =  \\arg \\max_{|| \\boldsymbol{\\phi_1} || =1} \\left\\{  \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^p \\phi_{1,j} x_{ij} \\right)^2 \\right \\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once $\\boldsymbol{\\phi_1}$ is found, we can compute for each observation $i$ the principal component score $z_{1,i}$, and $\\boldsymbol{z_1}$ is our new feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "We proceed similarly to find the other components: the $k^{th}$ component can then be found by subtracting the first $k$ − 1 principal components from $\\mathbf{X}$ and finding the weights that maximize the variance of the new projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in practice, the principal components are computed differently. Let's take a step back and reconsider our optimization problem above. When solving it, by adding a Lagrangian multiplier $\\lambda_1$ and taking the derivatives with respect to each weight $\\phi_{1,j}$, we obtain, with some reshuffling:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\boldsymbol{\\phi_1}  = \\lambda_1 \\boldsymbol{\\phi_1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ is the covariance matrix of our features. We can get similar equations for all principal components $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} \\boldsymbol{\\phi_k}  = \\lambda_k \\boldsymbol{\\phi_k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with linear algebra, you will have recognized this equation: it means that the ***principal components are the [eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors) of the covariance matrix of our features***! \n",
    "\n",
    "Not only that, we can show that, because $\\boldsymbol{\\phi_k}$ are unit vectors, the ***eigenvalues*** ($\\lambda_k$) are equal to the ***variance*** of the projections. Hence, the first principal component is the eigenvector of the covariance matrix with the largest eigenvalues, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, we can compute the principal components thanks to [eigenvalue decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix) of the covariance matrix or the more general [singular value decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition)(SVD)."

    "1. we compute the probability of similarity between each pair of data points in the high-dimensional space\n",
    "2. we compute the probability of similarity between each pair of data points in the low-dimensional space\n",
    "The objective is to minimize the difference between the two similarity probabilities to find the best mapping between the high-dimensional data and the low-dimensional space.\n",

We call $\\boldsymbol{x_{(i)}}=(X_{i1}, X_{i2}, ..., X_{ip})$ the $i^{th}$ observation. Note that in the previous section $\\boldsymbol{x_{j}}$ was referring to feature $j$, i.e., a column of the matrix feature, while $\\boldsymbol{x_{(i)}}$ refers to observation $i$, i.e., a row of the matrix feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to compute the similarity between each pair of data points. This similarity of datapoint $\\boldsymbol{x_{(a)}}$ to datapoint $\\boldsymbol{x_{(b)}}$ is defined to be the conditional probability $p_{b|a}$ that $\\boldsymbol{x_{(a)}}$ would pick $\\boldsymbol{x_{(b)}}$ as its neighbor, if the neighbors were picked in proportion to their probability density under a Gaussian centered at $\\boldsymbol{x_{(a)}}$:\n",

The perplexity can be interpreted as the number of neighbors for our central point. As a result, the variance is adjusted to the density of the data: smaller values of $\\sigma_a^2$ are used in denser part of the data space. \n",
