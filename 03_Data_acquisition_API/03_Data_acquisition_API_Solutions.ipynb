    "The goal of this walkthrough is to provide you with insights on exploratory data analysis throughout the use of a fun and interactive technique known as web scraping. During this laboratory, you will be provided with a broad overview of this technique as well as the major tools used in the process. You will also understand how data analysis can be conducted on real-time web data and hopefully see how this combination can be further applied to any other context. \n",
