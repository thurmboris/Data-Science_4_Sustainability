# Colab and Python Notebooks

## What we will cover in the lab

### Colab and notebooks

- What are Python notebooks? 
    - They are a complete narrative of code and comments that can render many HTML components, such as images, hyperlinks, videos, etc. Therefore, the goal of a notebook is to demonstrate some code or explain some idea in the most engaging way possible.
- What is [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb)? (click on the link to review)
    - It is a Python notebook that runs on the cloud so you don't need to install anything on your PC. It runs on the browser.
    - Difference between Code and Text/Markdown: A Python notebook contains two types of cells. Today we will deal with the text/markdown part.
	- You will need a free Google account to access Colab (if you do not already have one)
- Shortcuts for entering code and markdown mode in Colab.
    - Convert cell to code cell:	`Ctrl/Cmd M Y`
    - Convert cell to text/markdown cell:	`Ctrl/Cmd M M`
- Introduction to markdown
    - Headings, bullets, hyperlinks, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, etc
    - Tables
    - Latex equations in markdown
- Images, videos
- How to [load](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb) in Colab an ipynb from Github
- How to execute some Python code in Colab. How to save your notebook in your Google Drive space.

### Python

Python will be the main programming language we will be using throughout this course. To review some basics about Python:
- Explore the "Python Basics" notebooks in the [Resources](https://github.com/edoardochiarotti/class_datascience/tree/main/2023/01_Introduction/Resources) folder
- Practice with Python completing the exercises in the [Practice](https://github.com/edoardochiarotti/class_datascience/tree/main/2023/01_Introduction/Practice) folder   
- You can also follow this [Python course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) from Kaggle.

## Additional resources (optional)

- Introduction to [markdown](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb)
- Review [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for markdown features or the shorter [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Autocomplete in Google Colab for code. When you write Python code in Colab it helps you "autocomplete" the code. Check out [this noteboook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb#scrollTo=d4L9TOP9QSHn)
