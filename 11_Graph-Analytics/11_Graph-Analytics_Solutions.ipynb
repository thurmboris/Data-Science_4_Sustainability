    "[Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. These objects are referred to as vertices (or nodes) and the relationships as edges (or links).\n",

    "Graph analytics and [network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory) have applications in many fields including:\n",

    "### Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a few important concepts that we will use and illustrate throughout this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is **connected** when there is a path between every pair of vertices. A [component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory)), also called connected component, is a group of vertices that are connected to each other by paths. In a connected graph, there is one component: the whole graph.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The [**distance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_(graph_theory)) between two vertices in a graph is the number of edges in a shortest path connecting them. It is also called **geodesic** distance or **shortest-path** distance.\n",
    "- The **diameter** of the graph is the maximum length of the shortest path.\n",
    "- The [**average shortest path length**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_path_length) is defined as the average number of steps along the shortest paths for all possible pairs of network nodes. Let $V$ be the set of nodes in the graph, $d(s,t)$ shortest path from node $s$ to node $t$, and $n$ the number of nodes, the average shortest path length $a$ is defined as:\n",
    "$$a=\\sum_{s \\neq t \\in V} \\frac{d(s,t)}{n(n-1)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**adjacency matrix**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix) is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph, where the elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent (i.e., connected) or not in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [**centrality**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality) of a node indicates its importance in the graph. There are many measures of centrality, including:\n",
    "- *degree centrality*, defined as the number of links incident upon a node (i.e., the number of ties that a node has).\n",
    "- [*betweenness centrality*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betweenness_centrality), defined as the number of shortest paths that pass through a node. Formally, the betweenness centrality of a node $v$ is $g(v)=\\sum_{s \\neq v \\neq t} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}}$ with $\\sigma_{st}$ the total number of shortest paths from node $s$ to $t$ and $\\sigma_{st}(v)$ the number of those paths that pass through $v$.\n",
    "- *closeness centrality*, defined as the average length of the shortest path between the node and all other nodes in the graph. In particular, the *Harmonic centrality* of a node $v$ is: $H(v)=\\sum_{u \\neq v}\\frac{1}{d(u,v)}$\n",
    "- [*PageRank*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) is an algorithm used to measure the importance of each node within the graph. It was invented by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, founders of Google, to help rank webpages in web search. In a nutshell, Pagerank finds the probability that a someone wondering randomly on the graph will end up on or pass from a node. "
