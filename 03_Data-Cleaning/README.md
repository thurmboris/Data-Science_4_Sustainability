- [02_Data-cleaning-Key-concepts](https://github.com/edoardochiarotti/class_datascience/blob/main/2023/02_Data-Cleaning/Resources/02_Data-cleaning-Key-concepts.ipynb) covers:
	- How do we get data? What are the different types and formats of data?
	- What are the main data preprocessing tasks?
	- How to clean and transform data? Strategies and good practices 
- [02_Data-acquisition-cleaning-Pandas](https://github.com/edoardochiarotti/class_datascience/blob/main/2023/02_Data-Cleaning/Resources/02_Data-acquisition-cleaning-Panda.ipynb) illustrates how to clean data with Pandas
	- What is Pandas?
	- How to import, extract, clean, replace, merge, manipulate data with Pandas?
	- Application to the [Green Domestic Product](https://e4s.center/resources/reports/green-domestic-product/)

## Practice

- Once you have read the Resources notebooks, train your data cleaning skills with [02_Data-Cleaning-Pandas](https://github.com/edoardochiarotti/class_datascience/blob/main/2023/02_Data-Cleaning/Practice/02_Data-Cleaning-Pandas.ipynb):
	- Learn to to import data, deal with missing values, remove duplicates, and merge dataframes
	- You will work with real dataset: [Polity5](https://www.systemicpeace.org/inscrdata.html) and [Quality of Government Environmental Indicators Dataset](https://www.gu.se/en/quality-government/qog-data/data-downloads/environmental-indicators-dataset)
- (optional) Keep practicing your python skills with [02_Practice-with-Python](https://github.com/edoardochiarotti/class_datascience/blob/main/2023/02_Data-Cleaning/Practice/02_Practice-with-Python.ipynb)
